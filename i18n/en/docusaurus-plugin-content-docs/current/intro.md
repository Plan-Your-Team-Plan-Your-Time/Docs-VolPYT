# Introducing PYT

![](/img/en/banner_web.svg)

Today, organizations lack a centralized system that allows them to integrate tasks and the time it takes to complete them in one place.

Without this centralization, the metrics that can be extracted from this information are limited, which makes it difficult to achieve new goals optimally. Add to that the fact that it is usually impossible to effectively monitor the team's mood, and the team's overall morale and performance can deteriorate.

Consequently, business leaders are faced with a context in which more is demanded in less time. They end up unable to understand what is happening within the team or why significant delays occur, which prevents them from meeting deadlines.

Plan Your Team, Plan Your Time, specifically the VolPYT platform, has emerged to solve these problems.
